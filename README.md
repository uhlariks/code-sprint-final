This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The title of this project is simply Composting App. The idea behind it was to create a centralized resource of information and services for individuals who wish to compost in Chicago. Up until recently I wasn't aware of how simple it is to compost here in the city - I thought I would have needed a backyard at least or a garden of some type. As someone who cooks at home a lot, it's great that I can take this small step to being more sustainable in my everyday life.

This app is composed of three pages. The home page includes information about composting: what it is, why it's important, and what should/shouldn't be composted.

After learning how to build a quiz game in our class sessions, I thought it would be fun to include something similar in my project so users could test their knowledge about composting.

Lastly, the main point of the project was to include information for different locations about how to compost or what services are offered based on one's location.

Overall, I'm please with what I've managed to create in 5 weeks. If I had more time I would include more information about the services and include more locations to begin with. I would also like to build out the home page more to reflect my initial wireframe which included icons or images of the different types of compostable items.

One thing that I wasn't able to figure out is the transition of the "Game Over" text after the last question is selected. However, I'm just happy that I was able to get that to show up in the first place! Thank you, Michael for your help teaching me how to do that.

I really enjoyed learning about all the capabilites that react allows and I'm looking forward to building on to what I already know now!
